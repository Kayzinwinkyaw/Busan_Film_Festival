            The Beginning of the Busan International Film Festival
          </h4>

          <p class="desc">
            On September 13, 1996, the first opening ceremony was held with the
            desire to create a 'small but prestigious film festival'. The first
            international film festival in Korea took its first step amidst many
            concerns about holding an 'International Film Festival' in Busan,
            and not Seoul. In the first festival, 169 works from 31 countries
            were invited and screened in a total of 6 theaters.

          <p class="desc">
            The Busan International Film Festival has grown from Korea's first
            international film festival to Korea's largest, and has become a
            film festival loved by many filmmakers and audiences not only in
            Asia but also in the world. As of 2019, 299 works were invited from
            a total of 85 countries, and the number of theaters that started
            with 6 has increased to 37. In addition, the ‘Busan Cinema Center’
            opened in 2011, which is an exclusive venue of the Busan
            International Film Festival and has become a landmark in Busan.
